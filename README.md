___ZEXE___ (pronounced */zeksÄ“/*) is a Rust library for decentralized private computation.


This library was initially developed as part of the paper *"[ZEXE: Enabling Decentralized Private Computation][zexe]"*, and it is released under the MIT License and the Apache v2 License (see [License](#license)).

**WARNING:** This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype, and in particular has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Overview

This library implements a ledger-based system that enables users to execute offline computations and subsequently produce publicly-verifiable transactions that attest to the correctness of these offline executions. The transactions contain *zero-knowledge succinct arguments* (zkSNARKs) attesting to the correctness of the offline computations, and provide strong notions of privacy and succinctness.

- **Privacy** - transactions reveal no information about the offline computation.
- **Succinctness** - transactions can be validated in time that is independent of the offline computation.
- **Application isolation** - malicious applications cannot affect the execution of honest applications.
- **Application interaction** -  applications can safely communicate with each other.

Informally, the library provides the ability to create transactions that run arbitrary (Turing-complete) scripts on hidden data stored on the ledger. In more detail, the library implements a cryptographic primitive known as *decentralized private computation* (DPC) schemes, which are described in detail in the [ZEXE paper][zexe].

## Directory structure

This repository contains several Rust crates that implement the different building blocks of ZEXE. The high-level structure of the repository is as follows.

* [`algebra`](algebra): Rust crate that provides finite fields and elliptic curves
* [`dpc`](dpc): Rust crate that implements DPC schemes (the main cryptographic primitive in this repository)
* [`r1cs-core`](r1cs-core): Rust crate that defines core interfaces for a Rank-1 Constraint System (R1CS)
* [`r1cs-std`](r1cs-std): Rust crate that provides various gadgets used to construct R1CS
* [`gm17`](gm17): Rust crate that implements the zkSNARK of [Groth and Maller][GM17]

In addition, there is a  [`bench-utils`](bench-utils) crate which contains infrastructure for benchmarking. This crate includes macros for timing code segments and is used for profiling the building blocks of ZEXE.

## Build guide

The library compiles on the `stable` toolchain of the Rust compiler. To install the latest version of Rust, first install `rustup` by following the instructions [here](https://rustup.rs/), or via your platform's package manager. Once `rustup` is installed, install the Rust toolchain by invoking:
```bash
rustup install stable
```

After that, use `cargo`, the standard Rust build tool, to build the library:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scipr-lab/zexe.git
cd zexe/dpc
cargo build --release
```

This library comes with unit tests for each of the provided crates. Run the tests with:
```bash
cargo test
``` 

Lastly, this library comes with benchmarks for the following crates:

- [`algebra`](algebra)
- [`dpc`](dpc)

These benchmarks require the nightly Rust toolchain; to install this, run `rustup install nightly`. Then, to run benchmarks, run the following command:
```bash
cargo +nightly bench
```
