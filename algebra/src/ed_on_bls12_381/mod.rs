//! This module implements a twisted Edwards curve whose base field is the scalar field of the
//! curve BLS12-377. This allows defining cryptographic primitives that use elliptic curves over
//! the scalar field of the latter curve. This curve was generated by Sean Bowe, and is also known
//! as [Jubjub](https://github.com/zkcrypto/jubjub).
//!
//! Curve information:
//! * Base field: q = 52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184513
//! * Scalar field: r = 6554484396890773809930967563523245729705921265872317281365359162392183254199
//! * Valuation(q - 1, 2) = 32
//! * Valuation(r - 1, 2) = 1
//! * Curve equation: ax^2 + y^2 =1 + dx^2y^2, where
//!    * a = -1
//!    * d = -(10240/10241)
